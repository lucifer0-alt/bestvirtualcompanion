Unlike basic chatbots, companion apps often include memory, personalization, and relationship-oriented prompts.</p><h2>How they work</h2><p>Most products use large language models with additional personalization layers. As you chat, the app adapts tone and suggestions based on your preferences and past sessions.</p><h2>When they are useful</h2><p>Many users rely on AI companions for light conversation, mood check-ins, or confidence-building social practice. They are not a replacement for licensed mental health care.</p></article></main><footer class="site-footer"><div class="container">© <span class="year"></span> BestVirtualCompanion.com · Independent reviews by our team.
